## About

FrogLight is currently in a **very early alpha state**. Not everything is functional yet!

Because FrogLight does not come with any assets, you will need to provide your own resource packs!



> [!Warning]
> Modded clients, including this one, will get you **banned** from servers with anticheat!
> 
> You have been warned!

## Version Support

FrogLight is multiprotocol and supports release versions 1.20.0+, including:
- 1.20.0 and 1.20.1 (763)
- ~1.20.2~ (764)
- ~1.20.3 and 1.20.4~ (765)

> [!Note]
> Version support will be added after core client functions
> 
> Multi-protocol is already built in, but packets have not been created!

---

Support for new versions may be automatically generated using the included `just` recipes

There is no guarantee new versions will work out of the box, please test *extensively* before making a PR!

```sh
# Install just if needed
cargo install just

# Run the generator tool
# Manual cleanup is required!
just tools generate {VERSION}
```

## Configuration Files

All configuration files and resource packs are stored in the following directories:

| OS      | Default Folder                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/FrogLight`                     |
| Linux   | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/FrogLight`              |
| MacOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/FrogLight` |

## Building

Like most Rust projects, you can build the project using `cargo`

```sh
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EightFactorial/FrogLight
cd FrogLight

# Build the client, or
cargo build --release
# Build and run the client
cargo run --release
```

This may take a while and requires a couple of gigabytes of space!

The built client will be located at `./target/release/froglight`

> [!Important]
> Make sure you are building in `release` mode, as `debug` mode will be very slow!

## Plugins

FrogLight was written with customization in mind.

For example, here is how to embed an image and use it on the loading screen:

```rust
use bevy::{asset::embedded_asset, prelude::*};
use froglight_client::plugins::{AppPlugins, LoadingPlugin};

fn main() {
    // Create a new bevy App
    let mut app = App::new();

    // Create the AppPlugins group
    let mut plugins = AppPlugins::build(AppPlugins);
    // Set the loading screen to use the embedded image
    plugins = plugins.set(LoadingPlugin::new("embedded://froglight/my_custom_art.png"));

    // Add the plugins to the app
    app.add_plugins(plugins);

    // Place the image next to the main.rs file
    // and embed it inside the application
    embedded_asset!(app, "my_custom_art.png");

    // Run the app!
    app.run();
}
```

This is just a basic example, almost everything is modular and can be replaced!
