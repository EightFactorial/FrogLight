# MC-RS

A **highly work-in-progress** Minecraft client written in Rust using **[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)**.

Currently *aiming* to support:
- 1.20.1

Internally, MC-RS is written to support multiple protocol versions; however, only one is implemented to focus on the actual functionality.

More versions will be added at some point in the future.
