## About

It is currently in an **early alpha state**. Many things do not work yet!

FrogLight is a set of libraries for writing Minecraft clients and servers.

Almost every library is written to be used independently, though most provide additional features when used together.

Additionally, some libraries provide plugins for the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/) engine.

> Many servers do not allow modified clients!
