## About

FrogLight is currently in a **very early alpha state**. Not everything is functional yet!

This project does not include any assets, all assets must be loaded from resource packs!

> [!Warning]
> Modded clients will get you **banned** from servers with anticheat!
> 
> You have been warned!

## Version Support

FrogLight supports multiple different versions, including:
- 1.20.0 - 1.20.1 (**TEMP**)
- 1.21.0+ (**TARGET**)

> [!Note]
> Support for more versions will be added after core features and functionality.
> 
> Everything is built with support for multiple versions in mind!

## Configuration Files

All configuration files and resource packs are stored in the following directories:

| OS      | Config Folder                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/FrogLight`                     |
| Linux   | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/FrogLight`              |
| MacOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/FrogLight` |

## Building

Like most Rust projects, you can build the project using `cargo`

```sh
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EightFactorial/FrogLight
cd FrogLight

# Build the client, or
cargo build --release --bin froglight
# Build and run the client
cargo run --release
```

This will take a while the first time and requires a couple of gigabytes of space!

After building, FrogLight can be found at `./target/release/froglight[.exe]`

> [!Important]
> Make sure you are building in `--release` mode!

## Plugins

Plugins are very easy to create using the [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/).

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use froglight::plugins::{AppPlugins, LoadingPlugin};

fn main() {
    // Create a new bevy App
    let mut app = App::new();

    // Add the FrogLight app plugins
    app.add_plugins(AppPlugins);

    // Add your own custom plugins here!
    // app.add_plugins(MyCustomPlugin);

    // Run the client!
    app.run();
}
```
