# Froglight

[![Tests](https://github.com/EightFactorial/FrogLight/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EightFactorial/FrogLight/actions)

A **highly work-in-progress** Minecraft client written in Rust using **[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)**.

Currently *aiming* to support:
- 1.20.1

Froglight is written to support multiple protocol versions, however, only one is implemented to focus on the actual functionality.

Support for more versions will be added at some point in the future.

> [!Warning]
> While the goal is to emulate Minecraft as closely as possible, it will *never* be perfect.
> 
> Modded clients, including this one, **will get you banned** from servers with anticheat.
> 
> You have been warned!

> [!Note]
> The `main` branch is *mostly* stable, while the `dev` branch is unstable.
> 
> Development is done under `dev` and occasionally merged into `main`.
