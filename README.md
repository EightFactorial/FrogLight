## About

FrogLight is a set of libraries for creating Minecraft clients. Each crate is designed to be used independently, but plugins are provided for the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/) engine.

It is currently in a **very early alpha state**. Most things do not work yet!

> [!Caution]
> Some servers do not allow modified clients!

## Version Support

FrogLight has support for:
- v1.21.0 - v1.21.1

## Usage

FrogLight can added as a dependency in your `cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.14.0"
froglight = { git = "https://github.com/EightFactorial/FrogLight.git" }
# etc...
```

See the [examples](examples) directory for how to use the library.
