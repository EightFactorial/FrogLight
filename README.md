# MC-RS

A **highly work-in-progress** Minecraft client written in Rust using **[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)**.

Currently *aiming* to support:
- 1.20.1

The eventual goal is to support multiple protocol versions seamlessly.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

While the goal is to emulate Minecraft as closely as possible, it will *never* be perfect.

This client, like all others, will get you **banned** from servers with anticheat.

You have been warned!
