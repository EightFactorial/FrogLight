# MC-RS

[![Tests](https://github.com/EightFactorial/MC-RS/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EightFactorial/MC-RS/actions)

A **highly work-in-progress** Minecraft client written in Rust using **[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)**.

Currently *aiming* to support:
- 1.20.1

Internally, MC-RS is written to support multiple protocol versions; however, only one is implemented to focus on the actual functionality.

More versions will be added at some point in the future.

> [!Warning]
> While the goal is to emulate Minecraft as closely as possible, it will *never* be perfect.
> 
> Modded clients, including this one, **will get you banned** from servers with anticheat.

> You have been warned!
